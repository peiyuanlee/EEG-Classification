# EEG-Classification
Our goal is to categorize EEG signals from Brain Computer Interaction (BCI) Competition IV [1]. We explored various combinations of deep learning architectures with CNNs and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) as well as preprocessing techniques. Our most significant findings show that by employing a DTS-ConvGRU network, we achieved a notable accuracy of 72.18% across all subjects. We further explored the benefits of data augmentation through Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which synthesized EEG data closely resembling the original, thereby enhancing the robustness of our models.
